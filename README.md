3. Copy all of the code https://github.com/Bobrinik/wealthsimple_utilities/blob/main/download_portfolio_in_csv.js into the new script window.
    - Make sure to read over the code to double check that it's not doing anything suspicious. Such as stealing cookies or uploading anything.
    - I'm using the JQuery library, which is hosted by Cloudflare, and I trust that they won't be doing anything suspicious. But in our day and age, there's no guarantee the code supply chain will never come under attack.

5. Save
6. Go to Wealthsimple website
7. Login
